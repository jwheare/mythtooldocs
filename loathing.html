								<td bgcolor="#390000">&quot;If you want to play God, you need to create a world.&quot; 
									<p>Back in the day, when map editing meant hex editing, partially implemented tools, and lots of time in Photoshop, those people who could create a really slick map definitely possessed a slice of divinity. It took a lot of patience, a lot of skill, and a very empty calendar.</p>
									<p>Not that it's any different now, mind you. Loathing, the answer to the collective scream of anguish that occurred when map makers first started working, makes life easier. Note that I said &quot;easier&quot;, not &quot;easy.&quot; Make no mistake--making a good map requires a lot of practice, and a fair amount of skill. </p>
									<p>Loathing just makes it a lot easier to make a much better map. Anyone who has ever suffered through the creation of shadow, passability, media, and slope maps will adore Loathing. And those who have not will never realize that these tasks ever existed. Small comfort to those of us who finally mastered them...</p>
									<p>Anyways, if you're ready to forge a new world in the realm of Myth, dig in. The authors of this document have over a dozen maps under their belts, many of which you are probably already familiar with. We hope their experience will be of great benefit to you as you learn to use Loathing.</p>
									<p>After all, they made slope maps. Ooooh...</td>

								<td bgcolor="#390000">Loathing is a special, stripped down version of the Myth II engine that allows you to modify a mesh with considerably more accuracy than is possible with a couple of dwarves and wights. In tandem with <a href="fear.html">Fear</a>, it can be used to create entirely new and unique netmaps, limited only by the imagination and skill of the map maker--as well as a few limitations in the Myth engine that you'll eventually bump into. 
									<p>The first things most people do with Loathing is hurry into an existing netmap and change all of the warriors into Soulblighters and dwarves into Screaming Iron Assault Dwarves. This is quick, easy, and healthy. These maps might not be too much fun to play, but making them is really good practice for a new map maker. </p>
									<p>Later on, you will be creating new mesh, importing color and media maps, generating units sets from scratch, and eventually tweaking a nearly finished map. Loathing can do all of these things, and with a minimum in ritual sacrifices and voodoo rites. Read on to see how.</p>
									<p>This document has now been updated to describe features offered in the latest version of Myth.  Look for sections in italics and especially passages marked with a big red <b><font color="red">*version*</font></b> to see what's changed. Features not introduced in the latest major version will be marked with an orange <b><font color="orange">*version*</font></b> instead.

								<td align="right" bgcolor="#3c0000"></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td bgcolor="#390000" colspan="2">The first step in creating a map is understanding what is involved. Myth uses a powerful system of objects known as tags. Tags are Bungie's own platform-independent data format capable of storing everything from the units in the game and their behavior to the graphics and textures you see in a level. Creation of a map is simply the creation and careful integration of numerous tags. Once you know what the various tags mean, using Bungie's intuitive editors will make more sense. What follows is a description of some of the tags that exist in Myth and their purposes in the game. 
									<ul>
										<li><b>Collection</b> - The collection tag is one of the most universal tags in the game. Collections store all of Myth's two-dimensional graphics. All interface elements, all textures, all monster and player graphics, and all scenery are stored in collection tags. 
										<li><b>Collection Reference</b> - The collection reference is, as you might expect, a reference to a collection tag. Some collection tags have colors in them that are treated as &quot;transparent&quot; by the Myth engine. For each of these colors, the collection reference can substitute in its own colors. This is very helpful in creating one object of many different colors. As an example, a tree could appear as a summer tree with a collection reference featuring shades of green, and then be used again later as an autumn tree with a collection reference containing orange and red as its colors. Collection references also contain a &quot;tint&quot; which can be used to give an object a dark feel appropriate to a night map. 
										<li><b>String</b> - String tags are relatively simple tags, but they play an important role in developing a map. They contain text strings for use in maps, units, and other places. As an example, the name of a map and the description of a unit are kept in string tags. 
										<li><b>Projectiles and Projectile Groups</b> - The projectile tag is a very interesting part of the Myth engine. It can take the form of flaming arrows, a warrior's sword swing, or a dwarf's bottle. These are one of the only things in the Myth engine that can actually cause damage to units. Projectiles can call other tags such as Lightning or Projectile groups. Projectile groups are, as you might expect, groups of projectiles. Each projectile can call a projectile group, which in turn can call as many as 15 more projectiles. This is a powerful and useful feature, but be careful what you create. If you overuse this, you will slow the engine down, and create unusable maps. 
										<li><b>Local Projectile Groups</b> - These are special groups of particles that react to special physics models, and are responsible for such special effects as smoke, fires, magical effects, and all sorts of other strange things. 
										<li><b>Mesh</b> - The mesh is by far the most important piece of a Myth map. Basically, the mesh contains all information about the organization, layout, and structure of a Myth map. Important elements such as scenery/unit placement, as well as ground elevation, terrain type, and more are kept in the mesh. Since this tag is so important and contains so many things, each of its components will be discussed individually: 
										<ul>
											<li><b>Submeshes</b> - Every mesh is composed of one or more submeshes. A submesh is a 256x256 pixel section of the mesh. This is the basic unit of size for mesh tags, and as such, all meshes must have dimensions that are a multiple of 256 pixels. 
											<li><b>Object placement</b> - All objects that exist on a map, including 3D models, player-controlled units, non-player characters such as villagers, monsters, scenery, ambient sounds, projectiles, and weather are located and placed by the mesh. 
											<li><b>Color Map (Texture map)</b> - The color map is the actual texture that the player sees. All map details such as grass, dirt, walkways, paths, and any other details not added through models or scenery must be painted onto the color map. 
											<li><b>Displacement Map (Elevation)</b> - One of the most important factors in determining the quality of a map is the elevation of the terrain. The displacement map in the mesh contains all information about where hills, valleys, and stream beds exist in the map. 
											<li><b>Shadow Map</b> - The shadow map determines where shadows appear on the map. It is important that the shadows are placed in the shadow map and not in the color map so that shadows from units and projectiles display correctly. 
											<li><b>Reflection Map</b> - This data determines which areas of the map show reflectivity because of the presence of media. For media to reflect correctly, it must be marked as such in the Waterfx map. 
											<li><b>Terrain Map</b> - Similar to the slope map, passability is determined by data in the mesh. Dwarves, for example, cannot get to all the areas that ghols can (their legs are just too short). They cannot pass through medium depth water or climb steep hills. Some places are so steep that only flying units such as soulless can reach them. 
											<li><b>Media</b> - The presence or absence of media such as water or lava is determined by its selection and placement in the mesh. 
											<li><b>Slope</b> - Myth has a very sophisticated physics model. Balls and heads roll downhill when sent in the right direction. The slope is the way a map determines what areas are steep enough to warrant such behavior by the Myth engine. The steepness of all areas of the landscape are kept in the slope information of the mesh. 
											<li><b>Collection</b> - While the mesh does not contain any collection tags, it does contain references to the tags it needs. A mesh needs a collection tag for the texture map, and another one for the overhead map. If the map is a multiplayer level, then a pregame collection tag is also necessary. 
											<li><b>Map Actions</b> - Map actions are one of the most interesting and powerful aspects of Myth maps. They are the programming behind the computer's actions on a solo or multiplayer map. They determine what causes a win or loss of a game, and how all non-player characters behave. 
											<li><b>Other Data</b> - There is a lot more data stored in a mesh as well. Game types, references to text strings, next/previous level information, and more is stored in the mesh.

								<td bgcolor="#390000" colspan="2">Before launching Loathing, you will need a color map--the flat image that will be laid over the mesh to create the terrain for your map. This image will determine your map's size, and its dimensions (in pixels) must be divisible by 256. Color maps must use no more than 240 colors and need to be stored in PICT format on the Mac, or bmp on Windows. Color maps will be discussed in greater detail in the<a href="#color"> color map</a> section. 
									<p>If you are feeling ambitious, you can also create a grayscale image for a displacement map--the altitudes for the various points of your mesh. White is high, black is low. If you choose to create a displacement map, it needs to line up with the color map, and be the same size. You can find more information on displacement maps in the<a href="#color"> color map</a> section.</p>
									<p>After you launch Loathing, select &quot;New&quot; from the &quot;File&quot; menu. Enter a map name in the first dialog box; we recommend that you choose a descriptive one that can be understood by other people. You can change the name later if you need to. The second dialog asks for the media type, choose &quot;Water.&quot; You will learn more about media in the<a href="#color"> color map</a> section. The third and final dialog prompts you for the color map. Choose the color map you created earlier. A new flat plane with your color map is created. Choose &quot;Save&quot; from the file menu.</p>
									<p>You have created a basic mesh. It does not have units or scenery on it, and is flat. Also, the camera will not be correctly implemented until you do so manually. Still, this is sufficient if you only want to view the map.</p>
									<p>If you created a grayscale image for a displacement map you can add height to your map by choosing &quot;Displacement Map&gt; Import&quot; from the Maps menu.</p>
									<p>To place teams on your map you first need to add Unit Types to the map. Double-click on the Unit Tool (body icon). Use the Add button to introduce different troops to your map. Each unit needs to be assigned to a team. If a unit appears on more than one team, you need to create an instance for each team. Keep it simple: only use a few units types at first, and only one or two teams. Ignore the various check boxes. After closing the dialog with the OK button you are ready to place units on your map. Each time you click on the map (in the 3d window) you add a unit at that location; the unit type is chosen in the unit dialog window.</p>
									<p>You also need to place an Observer (camera) for each team. Double-click on the Observer Tool (eyeball icon). Use the Add button to create observers for each team, Value is the number of each team, enter &quot;1&quot; for Team 1, &quot;2&quot; for Team 2, etc.. After closing the dialog, place a single observer for each team: choose each team from the observer dialog window and click once on the map for each team.</p>
									<p>If you added a displacement map and/or units you need to save your map again.</p>
									<p>The map you have created will not be displayed in Myth II yet. You must first edit your map with <a href="fear.html">Fear</a>. When Fear has finished launching, double click on the folder &quot;Meshes&quot; in the &quot;Tags&quot; list, and choose the mesh you created. Check the box labeled &quot;Is complete&quot; from the Flags section. This is technically not true, you will be working on the map later, but for Myth to recognize the map it must be tagged as such. If you added units to your map, check the box labeled &quot;Body Count&quot; from the Game Scoring Types. Choose &quot;OK&quot; and launch Myth II: Soulblighter. Start a multi-player game. Choose your new map from the options dialog. Start the game and you can look at your new map. </td>

Here is an overview of Loathing's main, and some minor, interface elements. You will become familiar with all of these things over time, so don't worry if you're overwhelmed at first. <br>
									<b><br>
									</b>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Windows</b> 
										<ul>
											<li><b>2D view</b>: The 2D view window works much like the overhead map that appears in the Top Right corner of your screen during a game of Myth. You can use it to place or move the editing camera used in the 3D view. At times it also displays the locations of scenery or other markers placed on the map. 
											<li><b>3D view</b>: This is the view window that is much like the main view in the actual game. It shows you a 3D view of the terrain, units and objects. You can place, delete, and move objects, raise the mesh, and edit the entire map through the 3D view. 
											<li><b>List view</b>: This window appears when you click on a tool in the palette that has a corresponding pop-up menu. It appears below the Tool Palette and contains a list for these tools: 
											<ul>
												<li>scenery 
												<li>models 
												<li>units 
												<li>observers 
												<li>projectiles 
												<li>passability 
												<li>sound 
												<li>map action 
												<li>local projectile group 
												<li>model animations 
											</ul>
										</ul>
										<li><b>Menus</b> 
										<ul>
											<li><b>File</b> - New, Open, Close... If you don't know how to use 'em, learn. Only one map can be opened at a time. 
											<li><b>Edit</b> - Certain things such as unit placement are not undoable. But, a mistake like this is quickly alleviated with the tap of the delete/backspace key. Others can be duplicated, such as unit placements. Object placements, on the other hand, cannot. 
											<ul>
												<li><b>View Preferences</b> - Allows you to edit your preferences, including grid overlays, and whether you want media, objects or models to be displayed. Note that preferences for the various tools are not saved; they need to be reset each time you choose each tool. 
												<li><b>Tool Preferences</b> - Certain tools such as the Displacement brush have preferences, use this to edit the preferences for the tool. For tools that place objects like units and scenery there is only one option: &quot;Show All.&quot; When this option is unchecked, only instances of the current object are shown on the overhead view. This is very useful should you need to look at the placements of, for example, flags, deer, or wind sounds. 
											</ul>
											<li><b>Maps</b> - This is where you can import or export or edit these different maps: 
											<ul>
												<li>Shadow Map 
												<li>Color Map 
												<li>Reflection Map 
												<li>Displacement Map 
												<li>Terrain Map 
											</ul>
										</ul>
										<li><b>Models</b> 
										<ul>
											<li><b>Set Model Location</b> - Sets the X, Y, and Z coordinates for the selected model. 
										</ul>
										<li><b>Mesh</b> 
										<ul>
											<li><b>Bounded Observer</b> - Bounds the observer to the dimensions set in Mesh&gt;Set Mesh Parameters. 
											<li><b>Drop Observer</b> - Drops an observer camera underneath the current camera in the 3D view. 
											<li><b>Set Height</b> - Sets the numerical height of the selected point(s). Use the meshpoint tool to select points. 
											<li><b>Set Height to Zero</b> - Lowers or Raises the selected point(s) to zero. 
											<li><b>Set Media Height</b> - Sets the height of all media on the map. 
											<li><b>Edit Jitter Amount</b> - Edits the amount the selected point(s) are &quot;jittered&quot; by Jitter Selected Vertices. Try it, you'll like it. 
											<li><b>Jitter Selected Vertices</b> - Jitters the selected vertices. Do the jitterbug with your mesh. 
											<li><b>Edit Mesh Edge Raise Amount...</b> - this sets the height to which the map edges should be raised (see below). 
											<li><b>Raise Mesh Edge</b> - Allows you to edit the edge of the mesh. For example, make a large wall around the edges to prevent units from leaving the mesh. 
											<li><b>Set Mesh Parameters</b> - Sets how close to each edge of your map the observer can get. 
											<li><b>Shift Mesh Markers</b> - Shifts everything on the map, including heights and water however many units you specify in the dialogue that appears. Be careful with this one, there's no undoing. 
											<li><b>Recompute Mesh LOD</b> - Recomputes the LOD of the mesh fixing any abnormalities in the mesh. 
											<li><b>Export/Import Map Actions</b> - Export the actions for your map to text or Import actions for your map that you have made somewhere else. 
										</ul>
										<li><b>Selection</b> 
										<ul>
											<li><b>Edit Marker</b> - Edits the Marker. You may raise or lower the height of the marker, change its difficulty or other perform other actions. 
											<li><b>Rotate Selection</b> - Rotates the position of the selection you have made by the amount you have entered. 
											<li><b>Create Data Container</b> - Creates a Data Container in the Map Actions Dialogue. 
											<li><b>Create Squad</b> - Creates a squad out of the selection of units you have made. The squad will appear in the Map Actions Dialogue. 
											<li><b>Create Observer Movement Action</b> - Creates an action in the Map Actions Dialogue that will tell the observer (camera) what to do. (For example: rotate, pan forward, up, back, etc.) 
										</ul>
										<li><b>Windows</b>

										<li><b>Tools</b> 
										<ul>
											<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/01_Arrow.jpg" width="25" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Selection Tool</b> - Selects units, scenery, objects, and other devices in the 3D view. Clicking selects an object. Shift-click adds objects to the selection set. Click and drag selects all objects within the bounding-box. Units added to a selection automatically face in the same direction. The orientation of selected units may be changed by dragging (an arrow appears to indicate the new direction), and their position on the mesh can be changed by Control-dragging. 
											<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/02_Meshpoint.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Meshpoint Tool</b> - This tool turns on the grid in the 3D view. Click on a vertex to select it. Shift-click adds/removes vertices from the selection set. Dragging selects all vertices within the dragged region. Dragging a vertice raises or lowers any selected vertices. When trying to raise or lower more than one meshpoint, be sure to hold down the shift key. 
											<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/03_Displacement.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Displacement Brush</b> - This brush is used to raise or lower terrain levels in the 3D view. Use the Edit&gt;Tool Preferences... menu option to change the shape and function of the displacement brush. 
											<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/04_Terrain.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Terrain Tool</b> - This tool is much like the Meshpoint Tool, but it is used when dealing with multiple meshpoints, instead of one. This does not require that you hold down the shift key when raising or lowering multiple meshpoints. 
											<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/05_Submesh.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Submesh Tool</b> - Edits the mesh, shadows, and colors on a submesh basis. A submesh is a 256x256 unit. Therefore, a 1792x1792 size map would have forty-nine submeshes (7x7). When selected, this tool shows the outlines of the submeshes in the 3D view window. 
											<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/06_%20Scenery.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Scenery Tool</b> - Adds and edits scenery. 
											<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/07_Model.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Model Tool</b> - Adds and edits models. 
											<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/08_Unit.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Unit Tool</b> - Adds and edits units (troops and ambient lifeforms). 
											<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/09_Observer.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Observer Tool</b> - Adds and edits observers (cameras). 
											<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/10_Passability.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Passability Tool</b> - Edits the passability of mesh triangles, determining which units may pass over which cells.

								<td bgcolor="#390000" colspan="2">The displacement map is the mesh that makes up the contours of your map; it was frequently referred to as the &quot;height map&quot; by Myth I mapmakers. An <a href="gfx/displacement_map.gif">example</a> displacement map, taken from the netmap &quot;Gimble on the Wabe&quot; and reduced to one quarter of its full size, can be seen <a href="gfx/displacement_map.gif">here</a> if you still aren't clear on what these things are. 
									<p><b>Creating Displacement Maps</b></p>
									<p>Mapmakers for the original Myth relied heavily on grayscale representations of height maps. The lighter the shade of gray, the higher the altitude. These documents can be made and edited in your favorite graphics program, such as Photoshop or Painter. Counterintuitively, they must be saved as &quot;indexed color&quot; rather than &quot;grayscale&quot; before they can be used in Loathing. To import a greyscale document, select &quot;Displacement Map...&gt; Import&quot; from the Maps menu.</p>
									<p><b>Editing Displacement Maps</b></p>
									<p>Loathing introduces powerful mesh editing tools into the cartographer's arsenal. It is now possible to edit the displacement map completely from within Loathing, rather than starting with a greyscale document.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/02_Meshpoint.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Meshpoint Tool</b> - edits the mesh on a vertex by vertex level. When you select this tool a red grid is overlaid on the 3D window. Click on a vertex to select it. Shift click adds/removes vertices from the selection set. Drag click selects all vertices within the dragged region. Dragging raises or lowers any selected vertices; remember to hold down the shift key before clicking on a selection set or vertices to drag them. 
										<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/03_Displacement.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Displacement Brush</b> - This tool may be intimidating at first, but it is by far the most powerful and useful tool for editing meshes in Loathing. There are three modes for this tool: Raise Tool, Flatten Tool, and Filter Tool. The function keys controls the tool's behavior: 
										<ul>
											<li><b>F7</b> - changes the mode 
											<li><b>F8</b> - toggles the brush shape between circular and square 
											<li><b>F9</b> - decreases the brush radius 
											<li><b>F10</b> - increases the brush radius 
											<li><b>F11</b> - decreases the feather radius 
											<li><b>F12</b> - increases the feather radius 
											<li><b>Raise Tool</b> - This is the default mode, and perhaps the most useful one. The tool behaves like a magnetic brush, raising or lowering the mesh beneath it. The brush is displayed by two concentric circles or squares: the inner shape indicates the brush area, the outer displays the feather radius. You can adjust the rate of change by pressing the + and - keys on the main keyboard (not the keypad); the Shift key reverses the direction of displacement. 
											<li><b>Flatten Tool</b> - This tool flattens the terrain towards a specified height. You can increase or decrease the target elevation by pressing the + and - keys on the main keyboard (not the keypad) or in the tool preferences; the Shift key moves the terrain away from the targeted height. 
											<li><b>Filter Tool</b> - There are four filters available; each can be selected in the Edit menu under &quot;Tool Preferences.&quot; You can increase or decrease the filter effect rate by pressing the + and - keys on the main keyboard (not the keypad). 
											<li><b>Elevation Adjustment</b> - This tool raises only. 
											<li><b>Absolute Elevation</b> - sets the elevation of meshpoints to a specific height 
											<li><b>Smooth</b> - smoothes terrain 
											<li><b>Noise</b> - adds noise (bumps) 
										</ul>
										<li><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/04_Terrain.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Terrain Tool</b> - This tool is designed for band selecting. It is very similar to the Meshpoint Tool, except : 
										<ul>
											<li>You cannot select a single vertex by clicking directly on it. 
											<li>You do not need to hold down the shift key to maintain the selection set when clicking on a selected vertex

								<td bgcolor="#390000" colspan="2">A color map is the graphic which overlays the mesh. In Myth I cartography it was known as the texture map. The color map has the greatest influence on the appearance of your map. Keep in mind that your color palette is limited, and that an excessive number of different textures and colors will lead to jarring transitions and poorly rendered textures. An <a href="gfx/color_map.gif">example</a> color map, again from &quot;Gimble on the Wabe&quot; and reduced to one quarter size, can be seen <a href="gfx/color_map.gif">here</a>. 
									<p><b>Color Map Format</b></p>
									<p>The file has to be saved at 240 colors and 72 pixels per inch, and as a PICT file on the Mac or a BMP file on the PC. The dimensions of your colormap must be a multiple of 256 (the submesh size), such as 1536x1280, or even a very small mesh with dimensions of 512x512. If your color map does not meet this format, it may fail to load, or produce unexpected results.</p>
									<p><b>Importing Color Maps</b></p>
									<p>When you create a new document in Loathing, you are asked to name the map, and to choose its media type. When Loathing prompts you for a file, it is looking for the color map. Select the graphic you have prepared (make sure it adheres to all the guidelines in the Format section above). You can update or change this graphic at any time by choosing &quot;Color Map&gt; Import...&quot; from the Maps Menu. You can also export the current graphic by selecting &quot;Export...&quot; from the same menu. </p>
									<p><b>Tips on Creating Color Maps</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Using Photoshop</b> - The most common way to create and edit color maps is in 2D graphics editors such as Photoshop or Painter. In Photoshop, it is usual to maintain and edit the main document in RGB color, saving Indexed Color versions under another name as needed. Working with layers makes it easier to organize your document, and create smooth transitions. 
										<li><b>Bryce</b> - Color maps can also be generated with good results by Bryce 3D, a rendering package that specializes in landscapes. Bryce can automatically apply different styles of landscape textures to a terrain mesh. This involves importing a greyscale height image, applying a landscape texture to it, and rendering the image to disk from an overhead perspective. Bryce can also be used to create greyscale height maps and export them for use in Loathing.

This map is extremely important because it determines if the shadows on your finished map are consistent with those of the units and scenery. The light source is at 45&deg; from the northeast corner (note that this is the opposite side that most interfaces use, such as the MacOS interface, in which light always comes from the northwest corner... keep this in mind). Take a look at an <a href="gfx/shadow_map.gif">example</a> from &quot;Gimble on the Wabe&quot; (we really like that map) <a href="gfx/shadow_map.gif">here</a>. 
									<p><b>Creating Shadow Maps</b></p>
									<p>Back in the dark ages, creating accurate shadow maps was one of the banes of Myth cartography. They were usually made by hand, by a trick in Photoshop, or by rendering them in Bryce 3D; each of the three options was either inaccurate, or labor-intensive. Loathing has made this burdensome task trivial: choose Shadow Map&gt; Add Mesh Shading from the Maps menu. To update the shadows after you have been working on a section of the mesh, use the Shadow Map feature of the Submesh tool.</td>

									<ul>
										<li><b>Dwarf-Depth Media</b> - Most units can pass through this, with the notable exceptions of shades, which cannot pass over water of any sort. Like all media, this terrain type always kills fires. 
										<li><b>Human-Depth Media</b> - Hardy, human sized units and larger can handle this, while some other, more frail units (like archers and warlocks) cannot. 
										<li><b>Giant-Depth Media</b> - Only Trow, large Myrkridia, and dead units may pass through this terrain type. 
										<li><b>Deep Media</b> - Only dead or amphibious units may pass through this terrain type. 
										<li><b>Sloped</b> - Impassable to most two legged units, but passable to agile units like ghols and wolves. 
										<li><b>Steep</b> - Impassable to most units, with the notable exceptions of spiders and soulless. This terrain type is also non-flammable--fires will start, but they won't spread. 
										<li><b>Grass</b> - The default terrain type, flammable and passable to all current units. 
										<li><b>Desert</b> - Passable to all current units, nonflammable. Units also leave tracks over this terrain, as they would in sand. 
										<li><b>Rocky</b> - Nonflammable, cocktails break/explode easier, passable to all current units. 
										<li><b>Marsh</b> - Cocktails and other burning projectiles extinguish more often on this terrain type. 
										<li><b>Snow</b> - Units leave tracks, completely nonflammable, cocktails extinguish more often. 
										<li><b>Forest</b> - Not really used, and with no special effects. 
										<li><b>Walking Impassable</b> - Only flying units can traverse this terrain. 
										<li><b>Flying Impassable</b> - Used for preventing units from wandering off the map. No unit should be able to cross this terrain type. 
										<li><b>Scenery Impassable</b> - These purple cells are created automatically when scenery items are placed. This option is not available as an option in the menu window, and scenery impassable cells cannot be edited until the scenery is moved.

Attributes may be selected from this list, and applied to individual cells or regions of the mesh. There are three modes for applying Passability.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Default:</b> A single click edits all cells under the brush. Drag-click edits all cells that pass under the brush. 
										<li><b>Option Key:</b> A single click edits one cell at a time. Drag-click edits each cell that passes under the cursor 
										<li><b>Shift Key:</b> This option fills a larger region. If you click on grass, it fills approximately a window's worth, or 16 x 16. If you click on another terrain type, it fills (replaces) all the contiguous cells of that type. Think of it as a fill tool. 
										<li><b>F8</b>: Toggles brush shape between round and square. 
										<li><b>F9</b>: Decreases brush radius. 
										<li><b>F10</b>: Increases brush radius.

This means you may have a pool of water at the top of a hill, and also at the bottom. The water elevation is determined by the water displacement map. Contiguous parts of water do not need to have the same elevation, so you can have stream flow downhill, or even uphill, since the water in myth does not have a current, it is largely irrelevant. You can also set the media height of all the media in the water by using the &#147;Set All Media Heights&#148; option in the mesh menu, this can only be used to set all the media to a specific level within the map. To take advantage of multiple water heights, you will need to create a custom water displacement map in an external image editor. The elevations on this media displacement map use the same scale as the normal displacement map. </p>

									<p>In order to add troops to your map, you will need to first decide how many teams you will be using. In Myth 2, the first team is Team 0 and the others are sequenced from there. In addition to troops, certain scenery items such as Capture The Flag flags can be assigned to a team by assigning a team id number to them. Scenery items that do not start being owned by a given team, such as Territories flags, should be assigned to Team -1.</p>
									<p><b>Adding Units To Teams</b></p>
									<p><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/08_Unit.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> <b>Unit Tool</b></p>
									<p>Before adding units to your map, you need to construct a palette of units you will use. You need to create a separate instance of a given unit for each team it appears on. Double click on the unit tool to open the Unit Marker Palette. Add units to the palette by clicking on the Add button, or hitting Command-A on the keyboard. (The following options can also be changed via the Edit button).</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Tag</b> - The unit type. 
										<li><b>Team</b> - Enter the team number to which this instance belongs. If this unit is ambient life, enter &quot;-1.&quot; 
										<li><b>Uncontrollable</b> - Makes the unit uncontrollable. 
										<li><b>May Be Traded</b> - Allows this instance of a unit to be traded. If you want to have a unit that you must keep a certain number of but may trade some of them you need to create two instances of that unit, one with this option on and one with it off. 
										<li><b>May Use Veterans</b> - When this option is enabled, veterans from this instance may be carried over to subsequent games. 
										<li><b>Must Use Veterans</b> - This option forces all units of this instance to be veterans. By using this, you can make units only appear on a map if they are veterans continuing on from a previous level. 
										<li><b>Is Ambient Life</b> - Used for chickens, crows, and the like. 
										<li><b>Is Hunted Creature</b> - Used in the Hunting game.

									</center>
									<p><b>Placing Units</b></p>
									<p>Units are placed on the map by selecting the desired unit from the menu and then clicking somewhere in the 3D view. Loathing with create a unit standing on the point that you clicked. You can duplicate units, but all the duplicates are visible by default, and they cannot be reassigned to a different team. Note that you can duplicate selected units using the Duplicate command under the Edit menu, or Command-D. If you later decide to move a unit, hold down the Control key and drag it to its new position. Note that you can do this with multiple units by selecting them, and then Control-dragging.</p>
									<p><b>Selecting Units</b></p>
									<p>You can select units with the unit tool, but only by directly clicking on the target unit. You have to be careful where you click, or else you will create another instance of the current unit. You can add units to the selection set by holding down the shift key. Unless you also hold down the option key the direction that the units face will often be directly away from you.</p>
									<p>You can also band-select with the select unit tool by clicking away from a group of units, and then dragging the cursor over them.</p>
									<p><b>Orienting Units</b></p>
									<p>To change the direction selected units face, click on them, and drag the mouse. The units will rotate in place, displaying a purple arrow indicating the direction they will face when you release the mouse-button.</p>
									<p><b>Editing Units</b></p>
									<p>When you double click on a member of a selection set of units, you can change a variety of attributes for those units. The units in the selection set do not all need to be of the same type, or even belong to the same team.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Minimum Difficulty</b> - This is the minimum difficulty level at which units will appear on the map. If you set a unit as having a level of Legendary, then it will only appear on Legendary games. Handy for making more or less units available depending on difficulty level. 
										<li><b>I </b>- This is the initial east/west velocity of this unit. Since units never, ever use this setting (and it has no effect), it should be left at 0. 
										<li><b>J</b> - This is the north/south velocity of the unit. Has no effect, should be 0--see above. 
										<li><b>K</b> - Up/down velocity, no effect. 
										<li><b>Z</b> - This is the height off the ground at which this unit appears. Since units don't fall nicely, and tinkering with this will result in weird results, you shouldn't tinker with it. The exception is in the case of flying units, which you will need to move into the air, since all units are automatically placed on the ground when created. 
										<li><b>Yaw</b> - The is the direction in which the unit is facing. Much easier to set by dragging in the direction you want. 
										<li><b>Pitch</b> - Used only for models, and not much even then. Ignore. 
										<li><b>Invisible</b> - Invisible units are hidden until they are summoned by something like a map action or Unit Trading. If you make units invisible in a netgame, the can be traded for, but won't be initially present at the beginning of Unit Trading. 
										<li><b>Stone</b> - This makes units petrified upon entering a level. Not all that useful... 
										<li><b>Detonates Immediately</b> - Units with this option will detonate immediately upon being created. Handy for creating exploding wights, or maybe for scatting blood and guts over an area in advance. 
										<li><b>Is Invisible Observer</b> - This is used to create an invisible, uncontrollable unit that acts as an observer, allowing the owner team to see in a given area. 
										<li><b>Netgame Target</b> - Used for assigning the target in the Assassin netgame, or for livestock in Stampede games.
										<b>NOTE:</b> Units marked with this flag should only appear in their desired game type. For example an Assassin target with this flag <b>SHOULD NOT</b> exist under game types other than Assassin.
										<li><b>Respawns</b> - This unit will reappear Deathmatch-style when it dies.
										<li><b>Respawns Via Script</b> - The unit won't respawn automatically, but will need a Unit Control - Visible map action to make them do so.
										<li><b>Respawns at Death Location</b> - The unit reappears at the place where it died rather than where it started out.
										<li><b>Use Monster Entrance</b> - Unit reappears using its own Entrance projectile group rather than the teleport effect.

									<p><b>Adding Projectiles Types</b></p>
									<p>Before it is possible to add projectiles to your map, you must make a palette of projectiles. You may choose as many as you need, although too many projectiles could give the users of your map memory problems or lag. Double-click on the projectile icon in the tools window. You will be presented with a window which allows you to add, delete, and edit the projectile types in your palette. </p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Add- </b>After selecting Add (command-A) from the window, you will be prompted to select a type of projectile from all the valid projectiles that are placed there by default, or projectiles that you have made using Fear. After choosing a projectile and clicking OK, you will be presented with another window, to verify your selection. You have now added a projectile to your palette, which can later be added to your map. 
										<li><b>Delete-</b> To delete a projectile type, choose a projectile group, and click Delete (command-D) from the base of the window. 
										<li><b>Edit - </b>This button allows you to change the projectile type. 
									</ul>
									<p><b>Placing Projectiles</b></p>
									<p>After making a projectile type palette, you can add those projectiles to your map. With the projectile icon selected in your tools window, there should be a smaller window below it listing the projectiles you selected. By clicking on the drag-down menu, you can select the type of projectile you would like to add. Click on the map in the Visual window to add selected projectiles to the mesh.</p>
									<p><b>Placing Projectiles Within Scenery</b></p>
									<p>Placing projectiles in scenery is fairly involved process, but it gives people a good reason to pat you on the back. Before tackling this task, it may be a good idea to read the section on <a href="fear.html#scen">scenery</a> and <a href="fear.html#prgr">projectile</a> groups in the <a href="fear.html">Fear</a> manual.</p>
									<p>First, create a new projectile group containing all of the projectiles you want to fly out of a scenery item once it is destroyed. You can also assign sounds and mesh effects within the new projectile group window. Save your new projectile group with an appropriate name, and open up the scenery item listing. Select a scenery item that has the graphic that you'd like to use, and duplicate it. After naming it, open the new scenery item to edit it.</p>
									<p>You must edit a number of aspects of the scenery in <a href="fear.html#scen">Fear</a> to get your desired effect. The following steps can be edited to created different effects. First, since you want the scenery to explode, make sure the 'is solid' box is not checked. Next, edit the projectile groups, assigning which groups will come out of the scenery when it is destroyed. The group that is assigned to 'impact' will come off of the scenery when a melee unit attacks it. Most of the time, this doesn't need to be linked to a projectile group. The next menu, labeled 'detonation' is the group that will be shot off in various directions when the scenery is destroyed. Link your newly made projectile group through this menu, and save your scenery. To place your new combustible scenery on your map, open your map in Loathing, and place it wherever you want. If you followed the steps correctly, you should be able to spew chickens and various odds and ends from your scenery. </td>

								<td bgcolor="#390000" colspan="2">We assume that you are already familiar with the various net games from Myth. For netmaps with goals (such as flags and balls), you will find these goals in the scenery lists (specified by type for each net game). You can create palette entries, and place these items just as you would any scenery item. You can enable game types by opening your mesh in Fear, and checking the appropriate box(es). 
									<p><b>Selecting Game Types</b></p>
									<p>Not all game types are appropriate for all maps. For instance, King Of The Hill should be avoided on maps where a team starts on, or very close, to the hill. Maps for ball games should be free of places where balls can become trapped out of the reach of all units. It is often a good idea to create your map with multiple game types in mind, and tailor it accordingly. </p>
									<p><b>Game Types &amp; Requirements</b></p>
									<p>Some netgames require special scenery objects to be placed before you can play that netgame type.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Body Count</b> - No special requirements. Just units on the map. 
										<li><b>Steal The Bacon</b> - There must be a Steal The Bacon ball scenery object. 
										<li><b>Last Man on the Hill</b> - Netgame LMOTH flag. 
										<li><b>Scavenger Hunt</b> - Netgame Balls 1 -&gt; 9 . You can include one of each number, and you don't need to include them all (perhaps you only want a two or three ball game). 
										<li><b>Flag Rally</b> - Netgame Flags 1 -&gt; 9 . Same as with Scavenger Hunt, but with flags. 
										<li><b>Capture The Flag</b> - Netgame Capture The Flag flags. A separate scenery item needs to be created for each team, and assigned that team's number. 
										<li><b>Balls On Parade</b> - Netgame Balls on Parade balls. A separate scenery item needs to be created for each team, and assigned that team's number. 
										<li><b>Territories</b> - Netgame territories flags. You can place any number of these on the map, but do so intelligently. 
										<li><b>Captures</b> - Netgame captures balls. Otherwise the same as Territories flags. 
										<li><b>King of the Hill</b> - Netgame King of the Hill Flag. It is strongly, strongly recommended that all teams be an equal distance from this flag, or else one team might have a major advantage or disadvantage. Whatever you do, never, ever allow a team to start on a King of the Hill flag. 
										<li><b>Stampede</b> - Stampede requires designated units (often barnyard life such as chickens) for each team, and flags to designate a pen, or goal. The stampede animals all need to be checked as &quot;Netgame Targets&quot;, and the flags need to either be set to a team number, or -1. If they are set to a team number, only stampede target units of that team will be teleported out, whereas a -1 flag will teleport out all units. 
										<li><b>Assassination</b> - A target unit. A separate target unit needs to be added for each team. The target may marked as Uncontrollable for &quot;Choke The Chicken&quot; variations. The only netgame that should be selected is &quot;Assassination.&quot; Once the unit is placed it must be designated as &quot;Netgame Target&quot; by double-clicking on the unit, and checking the appropriate box. 
										<li><b>Hunting</b> - Ambient life forms. Deer, chickens, crows and other animals can all be added to the map. They all need to be assigned to Team -1, and marked Uncontrollable, Must use veterans, and Is hunted creature. All netgames should be unchecked for these units except Hunting. 
										<li><b>Custom</b> - For special scripted game types... you may well never have to use this. 
									</ul>
									<p>Before these net objectives can be added to your map, you need to construct a palette of net scenery items. Double click on the scenery tool to open the Scenery Marker Palette. Add net objectives to the palette by clicking on the Add button, or hitting Command-A on the keyboard; they all start with the word &quot;netgame.&quot; Capture the Flag and Balls on Parade require that you create a flag or ball palette entry for each team. All other net objectives should be assigned to &quot;Team -1.&quot; You can leave all the netgame types selected as Myth will only activate those netgame objects required for the chosen game. Close the dialog with the OK button when you are done.</p>
									<p><b>Placing Net Objectives</b></p>
									<p>The flags and balls are placed on the map by selecting the desired type from the menu, and then clicking in the 3D view. Keep in mind that these objectives need to be placed in a manner that is fair to all teams, but that some variety is also desirable to encourage different attack and defense strategies.</p>
									<p>Note that you can filter which objects are shown on the overhead by selecting Tool Preferences from the Edit Menu. When you uncheck the &quot;Show All&quot; option only instances of the currently selected item in the scenery menu appear in the overhead view. Thus you can see the placement of just the territories flags (for example). This is very helpful for balancing these objectives.</p>
									<p><b>Selecting and Moving Net Objectives</b></p>
									<p><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/06_%20Scenery.jpg" width="24" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> You can select flags and balls with the scenery tool, but only by directly clicking on the target item. You have to be careful where you click, or else you will create another instance of the current scenery item. You can add items to the selection set by holding down the shift key.</p>
									<p><img src="gfx/Tool_Pics/01_Arrow.jpg" width="25" height="21" naturalsizeflag="3"> The selection tool is often a better method of selecting and moving objects as it removes the possible confusion of creating new objects. You can also use it to band-select items.</p>
									<p>To move flags and balls, click on a selected object, and drag the mouse while holding down the Control key. To move items over a large distance (more than one screen's worth) keep holding down the Control key, and move the view with the keyboard. The selected objects will follow along.</p>
									<p><b>Setting Game Types</b></p>
									<p>After adding all the flags and balls to your map, you still need to specify the game types. Launch Fear and open the <a href="fear.html#mesh">meshes</a> folder in the Tags list. Your map should appear in the meshes list. Open it. In the <a href="fear.html#mesh">Game Scoring Types</a> section check all the options that your map supports. Click OK, and close Fear. </td>

							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td bgcolor="#390000" colspan="2">Actions scripting is not an easy task, and we recommend that users base their map actions on those Bungie has used for their maps. Indeed, unless you have had past programming experience, trying to create original map actions is ill-advised. The existing maps cover almost everything anyway, so completely original map actions are probably unnecessary for all but the most obscure uses. 
									<p>Anyone who has used a functional programming language such as LISP or Scheme should have no difficulty understanding the interface to the map actions. There are differences, to be sure, but the underlying formula is the same. Basically, all actions take in either a parameter or a set of parameters, and return a completion status. The primary difference is that the return isn't literal as in common languages - instead you have to query the action for its return. Also, the return does not occur immediately, and possibly never will while the map is being played.</p>
									<p>As with all programming languages, actions must be activated to execute. There are two calling mechanisms available within the system. Actions can be activated as soon as a game begins by using the Initially Active flag, or they may be called when another action returns a status of some type. An explanatory code equivalent may be found in Actions <a href="#appendixA">Appendix A</a>.</p>
									<p>The last important thing that remains in common with most programming languages is type matching. Loathing does a very good job of enforcing this, but if you want to get really fancy you ought to keep this in mind.</p>
									<p>Building good map actions essentially boils down to copying existing actions, or being good enough at designing them to risk making your own. Map scripts are complex to play around with, so, unless you need something really special, copying is a better option than creating original actions.</td>

										<p>This action allows you to run equations and alter the values of other parameters. It basically has four parts: a left value, a right value, an operator, and the result. Use this basic example of 1 + 2 = 3 to help you understand. The left value is "1", the right value is "2", the operator used is for addition, and the result is "3". </p>
										<p>For each value (left and right), there are multiple options. Integer parameters use whole numbers (i.e. -1, 0, 1, 2) while Fraction parameters use decimal numbers (i.e. 3.74, 4.22). If you want to grab the value from a different action you will need an Action Identifier and a Field Name. One is used to choose the action while the other specifies the four character tag ID of the parameter you wish to select. The result is stored in the "Result Integer" and "Result Fraction" parameters, but you can feed the result to another action using "Destination Action Identifier" and "Destination Field Name".</p>
